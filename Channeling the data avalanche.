Data is collected every day, every minute, every second, every millisecond.  Can you imagine all the pieces data that we provide to a massive database every time we login to our computers, search for something random we saw while watching our favorite Netflix show and it made us curious, do a mindless scross through our social media feed to stop long enough for something that caught our eye?  All those interesting, intentional, and unintential activites are data that is used for location tracking, interest engaging, digital marketing purposes and more.  When you stop and think about it it's hard to see how it's all managed.  Well, here's the kicker - it's not.  

https://bytesandbits.org/2021/01/30/learning-the-skills-for-your-next-job/ states that 80% of data that exists is not structured.  What does that mean?  Structured data is simply data that has been organized into a database that makes it easier to process and analyze.  You can think of it as an Excel spreadsheet where there's a table showing stats for your favorite baseball players.  It's easy to read and understand (process and analyze) to derive the information you want to know.  A database takes what that spreadsheet and table does and magnifies it by a 100.  With a database you're able to see data and it's connecting points to derive information that helps marketers, researchers, sports analysts and more make major decisions that impacts their company, clients or the general population.  

Data can decisions makers reach many vital and necessary decisions - so with 80% of the data collected being unusable there are decisions being made that may not be the effective or efficient but the best they can make with the information made available from the data that has been processed and analyzed.
