Query:

Dropping out of college is not uncommon, but how many students
decide without fully considering the pros and cons? I'm writing
a helpful guide for students that will provide some questions
they should ask themselves before making a final decision about
dropping out. It'd be great to get your input. What questions do
you think students should ask themselves, and why? I will likely
feature usable quotes in your responses. Some example questions
include: 1) What will you do instead? 2) Would a break or gap
year from school help? 3) Is it because of finances?
Requirements:

College graduates or college dropouts would be great to hear
from for this story. But I'm open to anyone who can provide
valid input. Thanks!

Are you ready to drop out of college?  We all know that 2020 was a rought year and 2021 seems to have us stumbling through to make our way through it.  We all have seen and heard how Covid has impacted businesses and schools.  Between the frustrations we're facing with digital classrooms and ever-growing student loans why would we continue to work through this?  It would be better to just call it quits and move on to something else - anything else.  Right?

Not quite.  I write this from a few different perspectives.
1. College dropout (and walked away from a full scholarship)
2. Mother of a child who graduated in May 2020
3. College educator
