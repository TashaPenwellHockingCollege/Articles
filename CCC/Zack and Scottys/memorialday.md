# Wall of Heroes

It's been a hot minute since I've been able to write on this platform.  Between real estate classes, teaching and most things still be restricted for traveling it's kinda taken the wind out of my sails but today's subject seems like a perfect one to get started for (hopefully) more regular posts.  Today, as we get ready for Memorial Day Weekend the focus is on a Wall of Heroes.  

The Wall of Heroes can be found inside Zack and Scotty's on Court Street.  Zack and Scotty's is a locally owned and operated popular restaurant in Gallipolis Ohio.  Zack and Scotty's is known for it's amazing owner Amy Disantis, it's homemade bread and their utmost respect love and support for the military.

Walking through their doors on Court Street you'll soon see why this restaurant is such a local favorite. Amy is one one the most personable people you will every meet.  She'll great you with a warm welcome and after hearing her infectious laughter you'll soon want to call her one of your closest friends.  She's a proud supporter of the community with causes related to children and veterans being closest to her heart.  She is often hosting or sponsoring fundraisers with her most recent one being for Harley's Place to help fund an everybody abled playground inspired by one of her waitress's grandson who has cerebal palsy.  

As you take your seat you'll be served by her awesome waitstaff and you soon see the Wall of Heroes. This is a wall that Zack and Scotty's has devoted to sharing the faces and the stories for all those who serve or have served.  You'll soon see that this Wall is one of the things she is most proud of and welcomes anyone who would to share their photo or of a loved one to the wall.  Images old and new, in color or black and white, uniform or out of are welcome.  Her love and devotion for the who have worn the uniform is evident.  

Some people talk about how big Zack & Scotty's menu options are (there's a lot) but once you're in the door you'll see that it's nothing compared to Amazying Amy and her love for her country and the men and women who have fought to keep the United States the land of the free and the brave.
