# Wall of Heroes

Today, as we get ready for Memorial Day Weekend I'd like to share a Wall of Heroes that I invite you to visit next time you're in Gallipolis, Ohio. 

The Wall of Heroes can be found inside Zack and Scotty's on Court Street.  Zack and Scotty's is a locally owned and operated restaurant on Court Street in Gallipolis.  Zack and Scotty's is known for it's amazing owner Amy Disantis, it's homemade bread and their utmost respect love and support for the military.

Walking through their doors on Court Street you'll soon see why this restaurant is such a local favorite. Amy is one one the most personable people you will ever meet.  She'll great you with a warm welcome and after hearing her infectious laughter you'll soon want to call her one of your closest friends.  She's a proud supporter of the community with causes related to children and veterans being closest to her heart.  She is often hosting or sponsoring fundraisers with her most recent one being for Harley's Place to help fund an everybody abled playground inspired by one of her waitress's grandson who has cerebal palsy.  

As you take your seat you'll be served by her amazing waitstaff and you soon see the Wall of Heroes. This is a wall that Zack and Scotty's has devoted to sharing the faces and the stories for all those who serve or have served.  If you ask Amy about the Wall, you will learn  just how near and dear the military is to her.  She welcomes anyone to share their photo or of a loved one to the wall.  Images old and new, in color or black and white, uniform or out of are welcome.  Her love and devotion for the who have worn the uniform is evident.  

Some people talk about how big Zack & Scotty's menu options are (there's a lot) but once you're in the door you'll see that it's nothing compared to Amazing Amy and her love for her country and the men and women who have fought to keep the United States the land of the free and the brave.  She's closed on Monday in observance of Memorial Day but if you happen to be traveling in Southeastern Ohio this Saturday looking for a local favorite as a road trip restaurant destination - head over to Court Street.  You won't be disappointed.
