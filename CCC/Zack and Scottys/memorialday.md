# Wall of Heroes

The Wall of Heroes.  One of Gallia County's most beloved walls in one of its favorite restaurants - Zack & Scotty's.  

 Zack and Scotty's is a locally owned and operated restaurant on Court Street in Gallipolis. They are known for their amazing owner Amy Disantis, Scott's homemade bread, and their utmost love and support for the military.

Walking through their doors on Court Street you'll soon see why this restaurant is such a local favorite. Amy is one one the most personable people you will ever meet. She'll greet you with a warm welcome and after hearing her infectious laughter you'll soon want to call her one of your closest friends. She's a proud supporter of the community with causes related to children and veterans being closest to her heart. She is often hosting or sponsoring fundraisers. Her most recent one being for Harley's Place. A cause to help fund an everybody-abled playground.  

As you take your seat and served by her amazing waitstaff, you soon see the Wall of Heroes. This is a wall that Zack and Scotty's has devoted to sharing the faces and the stories for all those who serve or have served. If you ask Amy about the Wall, you will learn how near and dear the military is to her. She welcomes anyone to share their photo or of a loved one to the wall. Images old and new, in color or black and white, uniform or out of are welcome. Her love and devotion for the who have worn the uniform is evident.

Her customers know how big Zack & Scotty's menu options are.  There's a large variety of American food and everyone has a favorite.  (Most will recommend the Scott's Torpedo Bread first thing - and with good reason.)  One of the things that keeps her customers loyal is they know that the size of the menu is nothing compared to the size of Amy's heart.  Amazing Amy and her love for country and the servicemen and women is nothing short of inspiring.  She's closed on Monday in observance of Memorial Day.  If you're doing any road-tripping this weekend and happen to be in Gallia County this Saturday, I highly recommend Zack & Scotty's as a road trip restaurant destination.
