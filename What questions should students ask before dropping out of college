Query:

Dropping out of college is not uncommon, but how many students
decide without fully considering the pros and cons? I'm writing
a helpful guide for students that will provide some questions
they should ask themselves before making a final decision about
dropping out. It'd be great to get your input. What questions do
you think students should ask themselves, and why? I will likely
feature usable quotes in your responses. Some example questions
include: 1) What will you do instead? 2) Would a break or gap
year from school help? 3) Is it because of finances?
Requirements:

College graduates or college dropouts would be great to hear
from for this story. But I'm open to anyone who can provide
valid input. Thanks!
