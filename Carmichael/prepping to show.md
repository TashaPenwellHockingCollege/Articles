County fairs in a small town are something we looked forward to as kids.  As adults it's a different kind of experience watching the kids and grandkids squeal in laughter with the rides and winning the prize from knocking over the bottles.  As an adult the fair food is a once a year treat you enjoy while listening to the music that you heard when growing up.  

One of our favorite memories growing up was also showing animals at the county fair.  The weeks were long and the preparation and planning was even longer but the memories and the lessons learned are ones that stayed with us as we work to help our clients and community plan for the unexpected.  We are looking forward to seeing tomorrow's farmers grow in their practice adn love of agriculture at this year's Gallia County Fair!

Here's a few tips that we have for those planning on showing soon!

1.  Know your animal adn work with it everyday. This helps build trust adn respect with your animal.  Building that type of relationship takes time, effort and consistency.  A routine helps them know what to expect and how to react with your direction.  
2.  Consult with a good veterinarian and nutritionist.  Part of the presentation is based on the fitness of the animal. Just as in us humans, good nutrition is vital for an animal to be of healthy weight.  Remember they are the star of the show.  Invest in the time and supplies needed for grooming.  In additional to outward appearances, take into consideration the stress of the animal.  As they gain comfort under your lead and began to feel more relaxed and secure their health will reap the benefits.
3.  Find a mentor to help share their experiences with you.  One of the joys of small towns is that there are plenty of individuals who grew up doing the exact same thing you're doing now.  Ask for their advise on how to develop good showmanship.
