Fair season is a great way to explore the beautiful mountain state of West Virginia. As you make your rounds attending the county and state fairs this year be sure to check out the natural attractions of the state as well. A personal favorite is the Fayette County Fair which is also home to the New River Gorge National Park.

Many of our farmer friends and clients look forward to the local county fair as a family vacation. Fair week is full of fun with 4-H, park rides, games, and learning some great life skills and responsibilities along the way. If you can, don't forget to explore the beautiful mountains and see why West Virginia is known as Nature's Playground.

Check out the below to see where else you can enjoy the West Virginia fairs.
