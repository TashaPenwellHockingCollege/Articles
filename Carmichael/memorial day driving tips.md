As we prepare for the unofficial start of Summer and its warmer weather, many of us are planning for a Memorial Day road trip.  We all know that it's important that your car is ready to take the road - but it's also important the drive is too. Whether your destination is an old favorite or a new adventure, here are a few tips to help you get started.  


1.  Get plenty of rest the days before your drive.  Don't exhaust yourself before your vacation begins!
2.  Plan on some healthy road trip snacks and hydrate! (it's cheaper and will help beat bloat and fatigue).  
3.  With all that hydrations comes the need for rest stops. The trucking industry has helped bring more rest areas like @loves and @pilot stations that are clean and safe to stop.
4.  Use energizing scents.  Peppermint essential oil is a great choice when needing a little pick-me-up
5.  Listen to audiobooks or podcasts.  They help keep the brain active and you spend less time looking for a signal as you travel further from home.

Remember that these are memories in the making with your family and loved ones.  Plan ahead of what you can and let the open road guide you to your destination safely.
