As we prepare for the unofficial start of Summer and it's warmer weather many of us are planning for a Memorial Day road trip.  


1.  Get plenty of rest the days before your drive.
2.  Plan on some healthy road trip snacks (it's cheaper and will help beat bloat and fatigue)
3.  Stay hydrated!  Water is best, coffee is good.  Avoid the energy drinks if possible.
4.  Plan your rest stops.  Thankfully the trucking industry has helped bring more rest areas like @loves and @pilot stations that are clean and safe to stop.
5.  Chew gum
6.  Use energizing scents.  Peppermint essential oil is a great choice when need a little pick-me-up
7.  Listen to audio books or podcasts.  They help keep the brain active and you spend less time looking for a signal as you travel further from home.
