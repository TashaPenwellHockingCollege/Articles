 Ohio is known for a lot of things...
 
 Football
 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
 The Wright Brothers
 Agriculture
 Cedar Point
 ...and for the ability to go through all the season in one week.  
 
 This little bit of instability in nature can make planting season a little tricky here in Ohio.  It takes a bit of strategy and experience to turn out a good harvest in the Fall.  With April leaving and us entering into May, now is the time to enter into the planting seaon.  According to Farmers Almanac 2021, the last frost should leave us by May 1 so the first week of May where we can go into our gardens full force with little worry about any frost to harm our work.  
 
 Planting season to harvest season requires a combination of heart, faith and hard work.  Every year, our experiences teach us new tactics and strategies to improve.  If you're getting started, here's a few tips to help answer the questions that come after answering the question of when to start planting.
 
 1. Available time
 2. Available space
 3. Size of your family
 4. Whether you plan to freeze or preserve what you grow

## Have a Plan

“It’s best to start small the first year then go from there,” says Bennett, adding that a 10-foot-by-10-foot garden would be a small one for a family of four. Begin with a list of your favorite vegetables, but don’t be afraid to experiment as well.
