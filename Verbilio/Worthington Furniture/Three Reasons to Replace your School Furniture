As summer break is officially underway, now is a good time to consider updating and replacing any furniture and supplies that may have seen better days.  It can be a little overwhelming to decide where to begin and prioritize what needs to be replaced.  Here's a few things to ask yourself when deciding.

1.  Review for physical damage that may or may not be temporarily fixed (i.e. duct tape).  Aside from the safety concerns of pinched skin and falling chairs, the appearance of broken equiment can be demoralizing to the learning experience.

2.  Comfortability and accessibility.  Styles change not only for design but for ergonomic, comfort and to meet the needs of those who require a different level of accessibility.  

3.  Function and form.  In addition to the seating and work areas that students use, having adequate storage can greatly improve the organization and accessibility of or items that teachers and students can access as needed and find items easily.  

Updating your classroom furniture can provide a better learning experience for your students and a more productive teaching year for you.
